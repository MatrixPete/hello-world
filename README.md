# hello-world
My first coding project

I will be tranisitioning from active duty Navy in the summer of 2017 and moving to the Sacramento area. I have a master's degree and management experience but want to learn the skills that are most in demand today and in the future. I am completely new to coding but have the ability to learn very quickly. Also, I have the luxury of devoting all my free time to learning and I plan to get all the certifications completed by the time I'm out of the Navy.
